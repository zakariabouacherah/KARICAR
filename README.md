# Car rental site

A portfolio project for a fictional car rental company. 

## Tech stack

- Next.js
- React
- Bootstrap (customised with SCSS)
- Vercel (for deployment)


## Overview

This is a simple website displaying information about a car rental company, including details about their branches, fleet of cars, contact information, etc.

One of the key features is the ability to get a price quote and begin a car reservation via the online form. This would be critical for a real business, enabling a smooth conversion process to maximise customer acquisition.
